    <h2>We've run out of ROMS!</h2>
    <p class="para">Our own member Meemo has took it upon themselves to call No-Intro losers! Thus behavior has caused attention from
        the people at No-Intro and they have since pulled all of our access to their special roms and we no longer have
        them. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
    <hr class="divider">
    <h2>The-Archive annual Pokemon Tournament delayed!</h2>
    <p class="para">It is regretful to have to say that the Pokemon Tournament planned for fuck idk, has been delayed. After careful
        consideration of not actually fucking planning it, we've decided that it must be delayed to ensure things go as
        smoothly as possible. Will let you all know when we have an update on the new schedule.</p>
    <hr class="divider">
    <h2>Threads are GONE</h2>
    <p class="para">NOT ALLOWED, DONT YOU EVER. STICKERS TOO YOU CUNTS!</p>
    <hr class="divider">
    <h2>We finally banned KUPO!</h2>
    <p class="para">After many complaints from the many people in our respected team, it has come to our attention that KUPO was
        getting on the nerves of many. After investigation, it was found that KUPO was indeed being <u>annoying</u> and
        because of this, action was taken.
        <br> So if you are one of those people that neglected to come by to talk in #general due to his spam, YOU'RE
        FREE! Come by and chat.</p>
