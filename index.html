    <p class="info">
        The-Archive is another non-profit preservation and digital archiving group which focuses on an
        updated, well sorted and perfect metadata archiving solution for digital media. We strive for long
        term, multiple storage medium archive for a various range of content from websites, books, games,
        software, video, audio and ideas. We serve a range of our content collections via Google Team
        Drives, although being private, all users are fully allowed to clone and re-upload any of our files
        to other locations. For security reasons, we are unable to give everyone access to our collections,
        but we publish rare and obscure content via torrents and open directories. We currently have over
        1PB (1,000 TB+) stored on Google Drive with a file count in the hundreds of millions.

    <div class="dividee">Why we do what we do:</div>
    <p class="info">
        90% of films made before 1929 are lost to time, many research papers and books are completely
        vanished from the internet or physical copies seize to exist. We at The-Archive care about these
        files, no matter how obscure, how crude or how controversial, we want it archived. As put by fellow
        Digital Preservation Group, The-eye.eu; "Our mission is preserve pieces of digital history. We are
        digital librarians."

    <div class="dividee">Our History:</div>
    <p class="info">
        The-Archive started as a small group to collect, dump and rip handheld and console ROMs. We quickly
        obtained full collections of these systems and related media with the assistance of Metadata
        databases such as No-Intro, Redump and TOSEC. We then ran into a dilemma. We had amassed so much
        content, with such a high standard, we decided to branch out to other mediums. This is where we're
        at today. Collecting, persevering and sorting millions of files a year. Just like Archive.org,
        The-eye and many other archive groups. We solely rely on donations and don't run ads or sell user
        information to any third party. We actually don't even collect information as we believe in a free
        and anonymous internet. Our current costs for our services exceeds past $100.00 USD a month thus any
        donation of any amount if thankful. We host all our discussions on our Private Discord server, if
        you would like to join. Please make sure you share similar beliefs and are willing to assist in our
        digital preservation projects. If you'd like to know what major projects were currently working on,
        please view the forums and the wiki page for more information. (Note, these projects make up less
        than 1% of our entire workload, these are our fully planned projects willing to be released sometime
        soon).
